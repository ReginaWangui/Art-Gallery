                <p style="margin: 20px;">Artshop was founded in early 2000.It provides youth artists with space and materials to create and market their own original art,
                   which is sold online, at the gallery and through events and exhibitions. 60% of all of the sales of artwork from the gallery goes directly to the artist
                    and/or to their school fees if they are below age 18. 40% of sales goes back into buying supplies, paying rent, and sustaining the art gallery. As of 2018, 
                    the gallery is currently self-sustaining through sales of artwork. 
                  we have been able to expand hrough the sales of our artwork and exhibitions.</p>
